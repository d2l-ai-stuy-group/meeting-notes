## Agenda

- Last Meeting Follow Up
- New Business 
  1. Decide if we should build a [study plan for the book](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preface/index.html#content-and-structure) or follow the one proposed by the [berkeley-stat-157](https://courses.d2l.ai/berkeley-stat-157/index.html) course.

## Notes

This was the [first meeting](http://lsc.cornell.edu/studying-together/studying-together-online/) were we setup our expectations, communication
preferences and plans.

The reasoning behind creating a study group for d2l.ai is because while trying to work on [kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-disease/data) or taking up on [challenges](https://www.notion.so/EMNIST-Classification-88da7ce8d92c48e9acfe955f9eb06f07) we find out that while it's possible to _complete_ them going beyond a mediocre results take us a considerable amount of time due to the lack of knowledge on some concepts which make it difficult to explore papers or experience.

And while the course may provide a better guide for the book, the idea is to cover the basics and [preliminaries](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/index.html) thoroughly to later decide according to the [content and structure](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preface/index.html#content-and-structure) how to read the rest. 

All members of the group **must complete each chapter's exercises before going to
the next** or claiming they have completed it. We are aware that most if not all
have bee already solved so there's no harm in make them public, preferable in a
personal github repository.

We have decided to meet once a week, every sunday, starting 2020-12-27 at 4:00pm
UTC -6 during that time we'll: 

- Check in-how is everyone doing? (5 minutes)
- Group generated summary (10-15 minutes)
  - We can use a little bit of time to get to a concensus about what could be learn from each chapter.
  - We can compare notes, discuss solutions or simply have a vague conversation.
  - Each chapter will eventually have it's own markdown file containing it's summary.
- Group members list which topics/problems they would like to work on, facilitator leads vote to decide how to prioritize (5 minutes)
  - Some of use will get stuck at different stages of the book, this will be a good time to vote how to help another member get unstuck.
- Get to work! (30 minutes, longer if this is a longer meetingâ€”schedule in a 5 minute break for every 60 minutes you meet together online)
  - Solve chapter's exercises 
  - Clarify topics.
  - Dive deep on related concepts.
  - Clarify expressions, formulas or notations.
- Wrap up: what are your plans for next time? (5 minutes)
  - Draft a meeting note.
  
  
During the week we can *contact each other preferably through discord* or
whatsapp although the former offers voice and text channels, streaming and pins.

We have also decide to make an attempt to the [workera.ai](https://workera.ai/) tests before the first
meeting and take the tests every now and them to see how much progress we have
achieved studying the book.

The overall goals is to be able to read with much less effort popular papers or
tackle kaggle competitions with more confidence.

## Action Items

1. Each one may complete at least three of the seven workera.ai tests, since we
   are learning about deep learning it would be a good idea to complete than
   one.

## Next Meeting

1. Discuss workera.ai results 
2. Confirm study plan and discuss expectations.
